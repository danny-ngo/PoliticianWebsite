          <section>
            <p>I’ve been a resident of this city for the majority of my life and a homeowner in District 18 for the
              last decade. I truly enjoy living here and I want my efforts as a Councillor to have a positive impact
              on the city. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any ideas you might have to improve
              the municipality.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Education</h2>
            <p>I completed my Honours degree in Public Administration and Political Science (BsocSc) from the
              <a href="https://socialsciences.uottawa.ca/why-social-sciences/undergraduate/programs/public-administration">
                University of Ottawa</a> followed by a Master of Public Administration (MPA) from
              <a href="http://localgovernment.uwo.ca/masters/index.html">Western University</a>.</p>

          <section>
            <h2 class="heading">Career</h2>
            <p>I began my career working with the Commissioner of Community Services and, after many
              excellent years, I resigned to pursue municipal politics. I’ve since had the pleasure of serving as the
              councillor for District 18 for over 8 years. I serve on both the Administrative Policies and Planning
              committees.</p>
